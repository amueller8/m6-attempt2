Fresh snowfall
kids poetry
*
I awoke to a scene
reimagined as white.
A crisp clean sheet
pulled over it tight,
and patterned with the placing 
of hundreds of feet.
Tucked in at the corners,
and patted down neat.
Glistening like diamonds
in the dawnâ€™s early sun.
A testament to perfection
until the moment I come.
To ruin this world,
feels so unjust,
but with a sled in one hand,
ruin it, I must.
