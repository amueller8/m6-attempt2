Made for Ducks
kids poetry
*
The sun didnâ€™t come out today,
and the sky was filled with clouds of gray
that held on loosely to their rain
before dumping it down again, 
and again,
until rivers ran where there once were roads
and canoes were paddled where cars once drove.
Those wanting sun were out of luck
for today was mostly just made for ducks.
