Run Like the wind 
kids poetry
*
Over oceans and mountains and fields it came,
building up rage while roaring its name.
Until it finally arrived outside of my home,
with me bundled up, inside on my own,
as it searched for narrow gaps under the doors,
exploring the crawl space and up through the floors.
Hinges began creaking as it whistled its tune.
Loose papers were spinning and danced â€˜round the room.
There was mayhem as the noise of banging repeats,
with me hid away under blankets and sheets.
After an hour, all exhausted, it calmed itself down,
and considered moving on to visit others in town.
If it lingers, my hopes will firmly be pinned
on a dash for the door as I run like the wind.
