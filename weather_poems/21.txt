Snowed Under
kids poetry
*
I was simply too busy
when the first snowfall came,
so I left it to sit on the ground.
As I waded through stacks
of emails and books,
with the snow sat in piles, drifts and mounds.

I worked ever so hard
each day and each night,
and snowstorms they came and they went.
The snow deep enough
to cover my car,
as I worked every hour that was sent.

By March, my whole home 
could no longer be seen.
My neighbors were all left to ponder
why I left it so late
to pick up a shovel,
as I'm now well and truly snowed under.
