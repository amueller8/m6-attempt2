Sunshine Beyond
Martha Shepard Lippincott
*
Though clouds of sorrow often fall
Within this world of ours,
There still is sunshine for us all,
With passing- of life's showers.

The flower, beaten by life's storms,
Will often raise its head,
And bloom again in loveliness,
When new sunshine is shed.

Though storms may oft oppress the soul,
And fill it with despair,
Do not despond and cease to hope,
For life will grow more fair.
